# RobertoCesa_Python_projects
Collection of functions developed in Python coding language for my Master thesis.
Functions are executed on highfrequency data sets (the framework is similar to the one provided by https://lobsterdata.com/) containing: 
- the state of the limit order book at each moment in time
- the events causing the change in the LOB
The file 'libraryMarketImpact.py' contains the functions used to quantify the impact that market orders have on the price.
The file 'libraryOptimalExecution.py' contains the functions used to simulate the optimal execution strategy.
